Just a fun side project(because I wanted to understand cosine similarity ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) to find how related are users replies on any given tweet by calculating their cosine similarity.

<h4>Different ways to find Cosine Similarity</h4>

- [] Cosine Similarity + Bag of Words (for vectors)
- [] Cosine Similarity + OpenAI embeddings API
- [] Cosine Similarity + word embeddings

<h4>How it works</h4>

We will have to scrape twitter to get the tweet replies (as Twitter API application is still pending) which then will be converted to word vectors and feeded into cosine similarity function to get the similarity score.
