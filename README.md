<h2>Tweets Similarity 🦜</h2

Just a fun side project(because I wanted to understand cosine similarity 🤷‍♂️) to find how related are users replies on any given tweet by calculating their cosine similarity.

<h4>Different ways to find Cosine Similarity</h4>

- [] Cosine Similarity + Bag of Words (for vectors)
- [] Cosine Similarity + OpenAI embeddings API
- [] Cosine Similarity + word embeddings

<h4>How it works</h4>

We will use Twitter API to fetch all the replies on a tweet which then will be converted to word vectors and feeded into cosine similarity function to get the similarity score.

Soon after some work... :D
